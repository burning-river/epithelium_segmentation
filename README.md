### Introduction

In microscopic cancer images, the morphology of epithelium (tissue that lines the outer surfaces of organs and blood vessles throughout the body) plays a crucial role in predicting overall survival and outcome in cancer patients. This makes segmentation of epithelium cells from stromal tissue a crucial step in  digital pathology. Manual segmentation of epithelia can be extremely cumbersome due to the sheer number of epithelial cells and their complex shapes (see example below). This is a problem well-suited to be solved by deep learning.
